# lcm of a, b is equivalent to: a * b //
# // is divide without remainder
def lcm(a, b):

# this is very inefficient

    # optimized solution
    # since lcm(a,b,c) â‰¡ lcm(lcm(a,b),c) we can use reduce to compute the lcm for 20
    # eg. lcm(1, 2, 3) == lcm(lcm(1, 2), 3)
    #     lcm(1, 2, 3, 4) == lcm(lcm(lcm(1, 2), 3), 4) etc...

    # lcm(1, 2, 3, 4, 5...... 20) is equivalent to: lcm(lcm(lcm(lcm(lcm(1, 2), 3), 4), 5), ....20)

    # reduce looks like this when printing out each iteration:
    # In [10]: reduce(print_and_lcm, aeiou)
    # 1 2             <--- these are the first two items in the list
    # 2 3             <--- 2 is the result of lcm(1, 2), 3 is the next list item
    # 6 4             <--- 6 is lcm(2, 3), 4 is the next list item
    # 12 5            <--- 12 is lcm(6, 4), 5 is the next list item
    # 60 6

    # 232792560 20    <--- 232792560 is lcm(12252240, 19) 20 is next list item
    # Out[10]: 232792560 <--- 232792560 is lcm(232792560, 20) 20 is the last item, so ths is our result
