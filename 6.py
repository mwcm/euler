# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 12+22+...+102=385

# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025

# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
# 3025âˆ’385=2640

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
